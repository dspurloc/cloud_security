## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -lah shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -lah gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -lah group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 602 group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -lah passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 602 passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):

2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

    - Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file: sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    - Updates to configuration file: minlen = 16
                                    minclass = 4

3. Force passwords to expire every 90 days.

    - Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users):
    sudo passwd -x 90 "name"

4. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group:
    sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): sudo usermod -aG engineers joe

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: mkdir -p ~/home/engineers
    sudo chgrp -R engineers ~/home/engineers


4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
    sudo chgrp -R engineers ~/home/engineers



5. Add the SGID bit and the sticky bit to allow collaboration between engineers in this directory.

    - Command to set SGID and sticky bit to shared folder:
    sudo chmod g+s ~/home/engineers
    sudo chmod o+t ~/home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis:
sudo apt-get install lynis -y

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
man lynis

3. Command to run an audit:
sudo lynis audit system
4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
sudo nano /var/log/lynis-report.dat
    - Screenshot of report output:


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:
sudo apt-get install chkrootkit -y

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
man chkrootkit
3. Command to run expert mode:
sudo chkrootkit -xman 
4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
    - Screenshot of end of sample output:
